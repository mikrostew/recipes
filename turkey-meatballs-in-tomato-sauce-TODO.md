 Italian inspired, healthy turkey meatballs in spicy tomato basil sauce with creamy burrata cheese. This one pan meal is savory, spicy, creamy, and makes a delicious weeknight dinner.
Ingredients

    For the meatballs:
    1 pound 93% lean ground turkey
    1 egg
    1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs (or if GF sub 2-3 tablespoons coconut flour)
    2 tablespoons fresh basil, finely minced
    1 teaspoon dijon mustard
    1 teaspoon italian seasoning (or sub dried oregano)
    1 teaspoon cumin
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    Freshly ground black pepper
    For the sauce:
    1 (24 ounce) jar your favorite pasta sauce (we love tomato basil)
    4-6 large basil leaves, julienned
    1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more if you like it really spicy!
    4-6 ounces Burrata cheese, cut into large pieces

Instructions

    In a large bowl, use your hands to combine the turkey, egg, breadcrumbs, basil, dijon mustard, italian seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne and salt and pepper. Mix together until well combined and roll into 16 golf ball sized meatballs.

    Place a large skillet over medium high heat and add in olive oil. Add meatballs and brown on add sides; this should take about 5 minutes. You don't need to cook them all the way through.

    Once meatballs have browned on all sides, reduce heat to medium low and add your tomato sauce. Spoon the tomato sauce generously over the meatballs. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 10-15 minutes while you make your pasta (if making).

    After about 10 minutes, add the basil and burrata in the tomato sauce and/or over the meatballs; cover and continue cooking for 5 more minutes or until the cheese has melted into the sauce.

    Serve meatballs over grain or pasta of choice. Would also be great over spaghetti squash. Serves 4.
