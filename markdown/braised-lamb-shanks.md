# braised lamb shanks

## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 - 6 lamb shanks (or 2 big ones), trimmed of excess fat
* [ ] 1 large onion, diced
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic, minced [optional]
* [ ] 2 large carrots, sliced 1/2-inch thick
* [ ] 1/4 cup flour
* [ ] 4 cups beef stock
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups red wine (Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chianti, etc.) [optional - substitute with extra stock].
* [ ] 14 oz tomato puree
* [ ] 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* [ ] 2 beef bouillon cubes, crushed
* [ ] 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
* [ ] 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped ,divided
* [ ] 2 bay leaves
* [ ] Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

* Wash and pat dry lamb shanks with paper towel.

* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear two shanks in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Repeat with remaining shanks and oil. Transfer to a plate, tent with foil to keep warm, set aside.

* In the pan juices, sauté the carrots and diced onions until softened, (about 3 minutes), then add garlic and cook for 1 minute. 

* Add flour and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.

* Add stock, wine, puree, tomato paste, bullion and herbs. Stir to combine.

* Return the shanks to the pot.

* Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 – 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is falling apart.

* Garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes or rice.
 
### To Thicken Sauce

To quickly thicken the sauce once the shanks are cooked through and tender:

* Make a slurry of 3 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the sauce from the pot.
* Pour the mixture into the simmering sauce, stirring quickly until completely blended.
* Let simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until thickened to desired consistency.


## Notes

I don't know how they are cooking 4-6 lamb shanks at a time? (maybe they are smaller than the 2 big ones I had)
