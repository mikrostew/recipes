# sour cream pound cake

## Ingredients

* [ ] 10 Tbsp butter, softened
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar
* [ ] 3 eggs, at room temperature
* [ ] 1 tsp vanilla
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups (187g) flour
* [ ] 1/4 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] pinch baking powder
* [ ] 1/2 cup sour cream
* [ ] Confectioners' sugar (optional)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Grease and flour a 9x5 loaf pan.

* Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. Beat in vanilla with the last egg.

* Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Add flour mixture to the butter-egg mixture alternately with sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Transfer batter to the prepared pan and spread to smooth top.

* Bake until toothpick comes out clean, at least 55 minutes (TODO - timing). Cool for at least 10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Optionally dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

## Notes

I got this from allrecipes I think, but I didn't save the link. I remember halving the original recipe because I don't have a tube pan.

Not sure of the timing yet, since the first time I baked at 350, but that was a little too hot for this.
