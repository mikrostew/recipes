# banana bread

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups (187g) flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* [ ] 1/2 tsp ginger
* [ ] 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* [ ] 1/4 tsp cloves
* [ ] 1 1/2 eggs
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) vegetable oil
* [ ] 3 Tbsp butter, melted
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) white sugar
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar, packed
* [ ] 350g pumpkin puree


## Directions

* Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour an 8 x 4 inch pan. 

* Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, soda, and spices in a bowl.

* Beat eggs, oil, butter, and sugars together in another bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture (just dump it all in), and mix until combined (it will be thick). Stir in pumpkin. Pour batter into prepared pan.

* Bake for 50 &ndash; 60 minutes, or until done (toothpick comes out with a few crumbs). Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes. Remove bread from pan, and completely cool.


## Notes

This is my [banana bread](./banana-bread.md), substituting pumpking for bananas, and using different spices. Pumpkin is 90% water, and bananas are 75%, but I used the same amount &mdash; hopefully that will work ok.
