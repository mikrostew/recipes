# salmon patties

## Ingredients

* 1 can (14.75 oz) salmon, drained (no need to remove bones and skin)
* ~1/3 Cup minced onion (or shallot, whatever)
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/2 Cup breadcrumbs (or saltines, ritz crackers, whatever you have)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* ~1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce [optional, to taste]
* ~1 tsp mustard [optional, to taste]
* ~1 tsp vinegar or lemon juice [optional, to taste]
* ~1 Tbsp parsley, minced [optional, to taste]

* butter


## Directions

* Combine everything except the butter in a medium bowl and mix well.

* In a skillet over medium-high heat, fry patties in butter for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until set and golden brown.

I don't even remember what exactly I made last time, since aside from the main salmon/onion/egg/breadcrumbs you can put whatever you want in there. They're pretty forgiving.
