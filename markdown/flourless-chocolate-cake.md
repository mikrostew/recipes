# flourless chocolate cake

Good for Passover (no [chametz](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1742/jewish/What-Is-Chametz.htm))

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1/2 cup (115g; 1 stick) unsalted butter
* [ ] 6 ounces (170g) high quality semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
* [ ] 2/3 cup (135g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 1 teaspoon espresso powder (or starbucks instant coffee)
* [ ] 1 teaspoons vanilla extract
* [ ] 4 large eggs, at room temperature
* [ ] 1/3 cup (27g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon baking powder [optional]


## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Make sure you have a bottom oven rack and a center oven rack in place for step 5. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan, line with a parchment paper round, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cake seamlessly release from the pan. The cake WILL stick unless it’s lined and generously greased. (Trust me!)

* Cut the butter into pieces so it melts evenly. Place in a large heat-proof bowl. Add chopped chocolate. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Let cool for 2-3 minutes. You can use a double boiler for this step if desired.

* Whisk the sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla extract into the chocolate mixture. Whisk in the eggs until smooth. The mixture will be heavy and tacky, like brownie batter. Whisk in the cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder (if using).

* Pour and spread batter into prepared cake pan.

* Prepare the steamy oven: Place a large metal roasting pan or baking dish on the bottom oven rack. Do not use glass. Pour boiling water about 2 inches up the sides of the pan. (I just boil a kettle of water.) Quickly place the cake on the center rack and shut the oven door, trapping steam inside. The steamy oven helps guarantee an extra moist cake.

* Bake for 30 minutes until the edges are set. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean OR comes out with just a few moist crumbs. It’s important to not over-bake this cake, which dries it out. Begin checking it at 25 minutes. Don’t be alarmed if the cake rises extra tall around some of the edges and slightly cracks– this is normal (it’s the eggs expanding) and will flatten out as it cools.

* Remove from the oven, place cake on a cooling rack, and cool for only 10 minutes in the cake pan. Run a sharp knife around the edges to help release the warm cake, then quickly invert it onto a serving plate or cake stand. (If it cools completely in the pan, it’s very difficult to release from the pan.) Cake will be a little crumbly on the edges. Cool completely. I usually stick it in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.

* Once the cake is cool, top with [chocolate ganache](./chocolate-ganache.md) or [mocha whipped cream](./mocha-whipped-cream.md) (or both!).

I used a 9-inch square pan, so I did 1.5x this recipe and it was fine. I used a bread pan for the water, but didn't get it boilding first - will do that next time.
