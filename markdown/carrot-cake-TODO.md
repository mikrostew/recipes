Recipe Preparation
Cake

Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat two 9"-diameter cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds; lightly coat rounds with nonstick spray. If using raisins and rum, heat together in a small saucepan over low just until warm, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit until liquid is absorbed and raisins are plump, 15–20 minutes.

Meanwhile, toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes; let cool. Combine carrots and buttermilk in a medium bowl.

Whisk flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low and gradually stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with carrot mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; mix until smooth. Fold in raisins, if using, and walnuts with a rubber spatula. Scrape batter into prepared pans.

Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35–45 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.

Frosting and Assembly

Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in powdered sugar. Increase speed to high and beat frosting until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Place 1 cake, domed side down, on a platter. Spread ¾ cup frosting evenly over top. Place remaining cake, domed side down, on top. Spread top and sides with 1¼ cups frosting and chill 30 minutes to let frosting set. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides, swirling decoratively. Top with Candied Carrot Coins, if desired.


from the comments:

I made this cake for the first time a month ago and cut the white sugar down to 2/3 cup after reading the comments, but beyond that I followed the recipe.

The carrot cake itself was really good. The roasted walnuts elevated the flavor of the cake. Although the frosting was too sweet probably because the recipe indicates the we use almost a kilo of sugar. Next time I attempt this I plan on adding lemon juice so the frosting actually tastes like a cream cheese frosting instead of a butter frosting.

I added inch or two of fresh ginger and it was even fresher and better.

Great recipe with regard to airiness and moistness, but way too sweet for me. In the future, I'll cut down on both sugars.

The frosting was too sweet for me, but the cake itself was amazing.

I wasn't a fan of the frosting though. It was way too sweet and heavy for me.

I also use less sugars than what is called for in both the cake and the icing.

It's pretty complicated for a carrot cake and I recommend not using this recipe.

I followed almost all the instructions exactly (except I added less sugar I like it less sweet).

I did find it to taste oily so would reduce the amount of vegetable oil by a bir.

Super tasty, nice and moist - the raisins and the walnuts are worth the extra steps.

I did make a few little changes though, I used pecans instead and for the frosting substitute the vanilla for about a tablespoon of lemon juice.

Also I would cut back on the nutmeg just a touch, unless you're making it for a Christmas dessert.
