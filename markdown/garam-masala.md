# garam masala

In case I ever want to make this, since I could just buy it

* [ ] 2 each black cardamom pods
* [ ] 2 each green cardamom pods
* [ ] 1 tablespoon fenugreek
* [ ] 1 tablespoon chili powder
* [ ] 1 tablespoon cumin seed
* [ ] 2 tablespoons coriander seed
* [ ] 2 tablespoons salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon pepper
* [ ] 1 tablespoon ginger powder
* [ ] 2 tablespoons turmeric

* Over medium heat, combine all spices in saut√© pan. Heat and toast spices for 30 to 45 seconds until they begin to pop. Let cool.

* Using a spice grinder (an electric coffee-bean grinder, cleaned, can also work), grind spices into a fine powder (similar to black pepper). Store extra spice blend in an airtight container for up to one month.
