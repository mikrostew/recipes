# Lobster Mac & Cheese

Serves: 2

Total time: about 1 hr 20 mins

## Ingredients

(for 2 large portions)

* [ ] vegetable oil
* [ ] 3 lobster tails (5-6 oz each)
* [ ] 2 Tbsp (28g) butter
* [ ] 3 Tbsp (28g) all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1 1/2 Cups cold milk (12 fl oz; the small bottle at the grocery store)
* [ ] cayenne to taste (optional)
* [ ] 1/4 tsp paprika
* [ ] pinch ground nutmeg
* [ ] 3 drops Worcestershire sauce
* [ ] 4 ounces (112g) grated sharp white cheddar cheese
* [ ] 1 ounce (28g) grated Gruyere cheese
* [ ] 1 generous Cup (124g) elbow macaroni
* [ ] 1/2 tsp fresh thyme leaves (don't overdo this)

For the crumb topping (doubled from the original - I like a lot of breadcrumbs on this):

* [ ] 2 Tbsp (28g) butter (melted)
* [ ] 6 Tbsp (35g) panko breadcrumbs
* [ ] 4 Tbsp (25g) grated Parmigiano Reggiano

## Equipment

* [ ] Cheese grater
* [ ] Large pot
* [ ] Stainless steel pan
* [ ] Bowls, spatulas, tongs, whisk, strainer
* [ ] 2 Gratin dishes
* [ ] Baking sheet

## Prep (15-20 mins)

* [ ] Cut **lobster tails** in half, rinse and remove the vein.
* [ ] Cut the **cheddar** and **gruyere** off the blocks, weigh those, then shred. (I find it's easiest to grate onto wax paper, then combine in a bowl.)
* [ ] Measure out the **flour** and the **macaroni** (separately).
* [ ] Measure out the **paprika** and **nutmeg** (together).
* [ ] Measure out the **breadcrumbs** and **grated parmesan** (together).
* [ ] Put the 2 tbsp **butter** in a bowl for melting later.
* [ ] Strip leaves from **thyme sprigs**.

## Cook (40 mins)

* [ ] Preheat oven to *400°F*.
* [ ] Start a large pot of salted water boiling.
* [ ] Melt the **butter** for the crumb topping in the bowl (microwave 20-30 seconds), or in a small pan over medium heat.
* [ ] Heat a stainless pan on *medium-high* until hot. Add **vegetable oil** and sear **lobster tails** for 2 minutes on each side, then set on a plate to rest.
* [ ] Turn the heat *off*, and melt 2 Tbsp **butter** in the pan. Turn heat to *medium* and whisk in the **flour** (making a rue). Cook for a minute or 2. Stir in the **cold milk**, cooking until it starts to simmer. Reduce heat to *low*. Stir in **paprika**, **nutmeg**, and **Worcestershire**. Taste for salt. Let that cook for 3-4 minutes.
* [ ] While the sauce heats up and cooks: Pull the meat out of the **lobster tails**, and add the shells to the pot of boiling water. Cook the **macaroni** for 9 minutes, to about al dente. Roughly chop the **lobster meat**.
* [ ] After the **sauce** is done cooking: Turn the heat *off* and stir the **shredded cheeses** into the sauce until just melted.
* [ ] When the **macaroni** is done cooking: Remove the **shells** from the pot, and save two of the nicest ones. Reserve some pasta water, then drain the **macaroni** (use a strainer) and add to the cheese sauce. Add a few splashes of pasta water to the sauce, so it's not so thick. Add the **fresh thyme leaves**. Taste for salt. Add the **lobster meat**.
* [ ] For the crumb topping: Stir in the **breadcrumbs** and **parmesan** - should be just moistened. Season with salt and pepper.
* [ ] Divide the **mac and cheese** between the gratin dishes. Top with the **breadcrumb** mix.

## Bake (15-20 mins)

* [ ] Bake at *400°F* on a baking sheet for 15-20 minutes, or until browned. Don't overbake (sauce will break and get greasy), but use broiler for about 30 seconds at the end if needed to brown the top.

Let cool for about 5 minutes. Garnish with the shells and a sprinkle of thyme leaves.

## Notes

The recipe page linked above doesn't have the steps detailed, so I took notes on the video and posted the steps here.
Much easier than watching through the video every time I want to make this.

Chef John uses 2 lobster tails, but we like more meat than that, so I use 3 here.
4 is too many, because they are too crowded in the pan and don't get a good sear.
