# coconut shrimp + dipping sauce

## Ingredients

Coconut Shrimp

* [ ] ~1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* [ ] 3 large eggs
* [ ] 3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs
* [ ] 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
* [ ] 1 pound raw large shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached (or not)
* [ ] vegetable oil (or coconut oil for better taste)
* [ ] cilantro, chopped (optional)

Dipping Sauce

* [ ] 1/2 cup apricot or peach preserves (or whatever you have)
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon grated lime peel
* [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
* [ ] 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 

## Directions

Shrimp

* Start with 3 medium bowls. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in one. Beat the eggs in the second bowl. Combine Panko and coconut in the third bowl.

* Dip the shrimp into the flour, then the eggs, and then dredge the shrimp into the coconut mix, pressing to adhere as much coconut as possible. Set aside on a plate.

* Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet on medium heat. Fry the coconut shrimp in batches (don't crowd the pan). Fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes each side.

* Place the fried shrimp on a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with Thai sweet chili sauce, or the sauce below.

* Sprinkle with a little chopped cilantro (optional) and serve. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Dipping Sauce

* Mix together sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

## Notes

Best to do this with large shrimp, because using smaller shrimp takes forever to prep.
