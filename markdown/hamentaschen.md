## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, at room temp
* [ ] 1 cup (200g) sugar
* [ ] 1 egg
* [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] zest of 1 orange
* [ ] juice from 1/2 lemon
* [ ] 1 Tbsp milk
* [ ] 2 cups (250g) flour
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] pinch of salt
* [ ] (fillings of your choice)
* [ ] 1 egg
* [ ] 1 Tbsp water


## Directions

* Preheat oven to 375°F.

* Cream butter and sugar with a stand mixer. Add egg and combine. Add vanilla extract, orange zest, lemon juice, and milk, mixing until combined.

* Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.

* With the mixer on medium speed, add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients 1/3 at a time until just combined.

* Gather the dough into a ball, flatten, and cover it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

* On a floured surface, roll dough about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out 2-inch circles, and divide them between two large baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

* Drop 1 teaspoon of the filling of your choice (most Jews go with traditional raspberry jam, but chocolate chips, poppy seeds, and other jellies/jams are common too!) into the center of each circle. Use your finger to trace a line of water around the circumference of each circle and quickly pinch the sides together around the filling to create a triangle. Be sure to tightly pinch the corners—it's not uncommon for Hamentaschen filling to bleed out.

* Egg-wash the cookies and bake for 15-17 minutes until lightly golden brown. Allow 5 minutes to rest and enjoy with cold milk.
