# chicken parmesan

## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded thin
* [ ] Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* [ ] 2 cups all-purpose flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
* [ ] 4 large eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water and seasoned with salt and pepper
* [ ] 2 cups panko bread crumbs
* [ ] 1 cup vegetable oil
* [ ] 1 jar tomato sauce (TODO: amount?)
* [ ] 1 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced
* [ ] 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
* [ ] fresh basil leaves, for garnish

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 400Â°F.

* Season chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge each breast in the flour and tap off excess, then dip in the egg and let excess drip off, then dredge on both sides in the bread crumbs.

* Divide the oil between 2 large saute pans and heat over high heat until almost smoking. Add 2 chicken breasts to each pan and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and top each breast with some Tomato Sauce, a few slices of the mozzarella, salt and pepper, and a tablespoon of Parmesan. Bake in the oven until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with basil or parsley leaves.

## Notes

Alternatively, just continue cooking in the pan instead of transferring to the oven. Dump out the hot oil first though, into a metal bowl.
