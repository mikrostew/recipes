# pecan pie

## Ingredients

* [ ] 3 eggs, beaten
* [ ] 2 tablespoons (42g) honey
* [ ] 1 cup (328g) light corn syrup
* [ ] 1/4 cup (50g) brown sugar
* [ ] 4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla
* [ ] 1 cup pecan halves
* [ ] 2 cups chopped pecans, toasted


## Directions

* Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

* Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. If a well-done crust is desired, you may chill and blind bake it before proceeding. 

* In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogenous and slightly frothy.

* Line pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.

* Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating halfway through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn (see instructions for fashioning a foil shield above). When finished, the filling should be slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. The filling should register between 175 and 180°F (79 to 82°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving. 


## Notes

To toast pecans:

* Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until browned and aromatic, 7-10 minutes. Toss halfway through.
