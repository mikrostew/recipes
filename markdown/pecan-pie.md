# pecan pie

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 [pre-baked pie crust](./pie-crust.md)
* [ ] 3 eggs, beaten
* [ ] 2 tablespoons (42g) honey
* [ ] 1 cup (328g) light corn syrup
* [ ] 1/4 cup (50g) brown sugar
* [ ] 4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla
* [ ] 1 cup pecan halves
* [ ] 2 cups chopped pecans, toasted


## Directions

* Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350째F.

* In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until lighter in color, and slightly frothy.

* Line pie crust with chopped pecans. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.

* Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating halfway through baking. You can shield the exposed nuts with aluminum foil so they don't burn. The filling should be slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly. The filling should register between 175 and 180째F (79 to 82째C) on an instant-read thermometer. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving. 


## Notes

From https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-pecan-pie-recipe-easy-thanksgiving-dessert

* But I only toast the chopped pecans, so the whole ones don't burn while baking.

To toast pecans:

* Preheat oven to 350째F. Spread the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until browned and aromatic, 7-10 minutes. Toss halfway through.
