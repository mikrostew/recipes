# devils food cupcakes

Makes 12 cupcakes.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)
* 3/8 cup hot water (or brewed coffee)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup cake flour
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 + 1/8 teaspoons baking soda
* 3/8 cup (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
* 3/8 cup buttermilk, room temperature
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

## Directions

* Arrange racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350°. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.

* Whisk cocoa powder and hot water (or brewed coffee) in a small bowl until smooth; whisk in eggs and vanilla.

* Whisk flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add butter, buttermilk, and oil and beat on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until flour is evenly distributed and mixture is smooth. Add cocoa powder mixture and beat just until smooth.

* Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling two-thirds full (1/3 cup batter per cupcake is about right). Bake, rotating pans halfway through, until cupcakes have domed and spring back when touched in the center, 20–25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.


## Notes

From https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/devils-food-cupcakes, halved because I only need 12 cupcakes

Non-Dutch-process cocoa powder is sometimes labeled “natural,” and since all of the chocolate flavor depends on what kind you use, quality matters for these devil's food cupcakes.

For the hot water, I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, that got it hot. She doesn't specify a temp, so I guess it's not that critical? Seemed fine.

For the melted butter, 30 sec was enough to melt the whole thing after it was at room temp.

Do Ahead: Cupcakes can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
