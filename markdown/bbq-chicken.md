# bbq chicken

Easy meal in the oven

## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 chicken thighs, boneless, skinless (can do skin-on and/or bone-in, but that's more effort)
* [ ] BBQ sauce (or teriyaki)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 425Â°F, and set rack to middle position.

* Trim extra skin and filet if necessary, and season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place skin-up on foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until skin is bubbly and crisp, 20-25 minutes.

* Spread BBQ sauce over chicken and serve.

## Notes

Can also make other things in the oven at the same time - vegetable, potatoes, etc.
