# mocha whipped cream

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 teaspoon espresso powder [optional]
* [ ] 1 teaspoon warm water [optional]
* [ ] 1 cup (240ml) cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
* [ ] 3 Tablespoons (22g) confectioners’ sugar
* [ ] 1 Tablespoon (6g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder
* [ ] raspberries and a dusting of confectioners’ sugar [optional]


## Directions

* Using a fork, mix the espresso powder and warm water together in a very small bowl. Cool down for a few minutes.

* Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, cocoa powder, and espresso mixture on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping and piping on desserts.

* Serve cake with whipped cream or pipe it on top. I used Ateco 849 piping tip. Decorate with raspberries and a dusting of confectioners’ sugar, if desired.

I made this without the espresso and it was fine, might be better with it though?
