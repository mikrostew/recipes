# cupcake frosting

## Ingredients

* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 3–4 cups (360-480g) confectioners’ sugar
* 1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* pinch of salt


## Directions

With a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute.

Add confectioners’ sugar, cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes.

Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or more cream if the frosting is too thick. Stir in a pinch of salt if you like.


## Notes

This is adapted from [these snickerdoodle cupcakes](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/snickerdoodle-cupcakes-cinnamon-swirl-frosting/), which were ok, but the frosting was pretty good.

However, I accidentally only made it with half the butter (1 stick), so I will try again at some point with more butter and see how it goes.
