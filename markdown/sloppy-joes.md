# sloppy joes

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 lbs. ground beef
* [ ] 1 green bell pepper, minced
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, minced
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced [optional]
* [ ] 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* [ ] 1 cup ketchup
* [ ] 1 cup beef stock
* [ ] 1 Tbsp better-than-bullion beef
* [ ] 2 Tbsp brown sugar
* [ ] 2 tsp yellow mustard
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

* Add a drizzle of oil in large skillet set to medium-high heat. Add beef and brown, breaking apart, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to colander to drain.

* Leave oil in the skillet (don't wipe out), add onion and pepper, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds or so, until fragrant. Add tomato paste and cook another 30 seconds. Return beef to skillet and stir well.

* Combine ketchup, stock, bullion, brown sugar, mustard, chili powder, and Worcestershire sauce in a measuring cup. Add to skillet and stir well to combine.

* Simmer over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until mixture has thickened to your liking. Remove from heat and serve on toasted buns.

## Notes

**Next time:** instead of ketchup, use the full 6oz tomato paste can, plus 1/4 to 1/3 cup apple cider or white vinegar, and probably an extra Tbsp or 2 of brown sugar
