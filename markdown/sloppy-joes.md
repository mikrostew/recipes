# sloppy joes

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 lbs. ground beef
* [ ] 1 green bell pepper, small dice
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, small dice
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced [optional]
* [ ] 6 oz tomato paste (the whole little can)
* [ ] 2 cups beef stock
* [ ] 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* [ ] 1 Tbsp better-than-bullion beef
* [ ] 3 Tbsp brown sugar
* [ ] 2 tsp yellow mustard
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

* Add a drizzle of oil in large skillet set to medium-high heat. Add beef and brown, breaking apart, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to colander to drain.

* Leave oil in the skillet (don't wipe out), add onion and pepper, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds or so, until fragrant. Add tomato paste and cook another 30 seconds. Return beef to skillet and stir well.

* Combine stock, bullion, brown sugar, mustard, chili powder, and Worcestershire sauce in a measuring cup. Add to skillet and stir well to combine.

* Simmer over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until mixture has thickened to your liking. Remove from heat and serve on toasted buns.
