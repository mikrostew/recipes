# za'atar spice

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 tablespoon dried thyme- crushed ( or sub oregano)
* [ ] 1 tablespoon ground cumin ( see note)
* [ ] 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* [ ] 1 tablespoon toasted  sesame seeds
* [ ] 1 tablespoon sumac
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon or more aleppo chili flakes- optional

## Directions

* Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Store in an airtight container.

* For the most flavor, toast whole seeds ( cumin and coriander seeds) until fragrant, then grind.  This will make the most flavorful  zaatar. If you donâ€™t have whole seeds, feel free to use ground spices.

I bought toasted ground spices from the store, since those were available, and it saves me time
