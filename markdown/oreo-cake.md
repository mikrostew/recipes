## Directions

Cake

* This is the BEST Oreo cake because I use a scale so it turns out perfectly. ðŸ™‚ If you convert to cups I cannot guarantee good results. Make sure your (cold ingredients) butter, eggs, and milk are at room temperature or a little warm.
* I microwave my milk for about 30 seconds and place my eggs (still in the shells) in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes.
* Preheat your oven to 335ÂºF (168ÂºC) and prepare three, 6"x2" cake pans with cake goop or another preferred pan release.
* In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
* Combine the milk, oil, and vanilla extract in a separate cup. Set aside.
* Place the softened butter in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and cream until smooth. Sprinkle in your sugar and then let whip on medium-high until light, white, and fluffy (about 5 minutes).
* I'm using my Bosch Universal Plus stand mixer, a KitchenAid will work as well. I wouldn't recommend using a hand mixer but if that's all you have, make sure to go by look and consistency instead of time. (See pictures above.)
* While mixing on low, slowly add the egg whites to the mixture one at a time, letting each fully combine before adding the next. (Cold egg whites will curdle the batter, so make sure they're room-temperature.)
* Add in 1/3 of your dry ingredients to the mixture and mix on low until just combined. Then add in 1/2 of your liquids, then 1/3 dry, then 1/2 liquids, and the rest of your dry. Let it mix until just combined. Do not overmix!
* Scrape the cream filling from the Oreos and discard or save and mix into your Oreo frosting, then roughly chop the oreos into 1/4-inch chunks.
* Divide the batter evenly into prepared cake pans and sprinkle the chopped oreos on top of each pan. Gently fold the oreos into the batter with a knife until just combined.
* Bake cakes at 335Âº F for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when poked in the center.
* If you're using two, 8"x2" pans, bake for longer.
* Let the cakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes or until the pan feels barely warm then turn out cakes onto a cooling rack. Place them into the freezer to flash chill, or wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 week. This locks in the moisture.
* Once cool, you can then trim off the brown edges and domes of your cakes (optional) and frost as desired. I do a crumb coat, freeze the cake for 15 minutes, then do a final coat, combine my leftover buttercream with the crushed Oreos, and top the cake with some dollops and whole oreos.

Buttercream

* Beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar and cream and mix. 
* Reserve about a cup of the buttercream for the white dollops. Which will be piped with an 869 tip.
* Mix in the crushed Oreos into the large batch of buttercream.

Ganache

* Melt chocolate and cream together on low heat. Whisk together and set aside. You might need to add more or less cream to achieve the desired consistency. 

Assembly

* Oreo buttercream goes between each layer as well as a swirl of chocolate. Don't go overboard with the ganache as it will overpower the other flavors.
* Coat outside with buttercream and smooth.
* Add a skirt of crushed Oreos at the bottom of the cake.
* Pour the ganache on top and allow to drip. Smooth top with an offset spatula.
* Pipe white buttercream dollops on top with an 869 tip

## Notes

Started with https://preppykitchen.com/cookies-and-cream-cake/, because that was the top result that didn't use chocolate layers when I [searched for oreo cake](https://www.google.com/search?q=oreo+cake).
(I don't want to do chocolate layers)
And I like the idea of also using ganache.

The recipe seemed to be a vanilla cake with chopped Oreos in it, buttercream with crushed Oreos, and ganache.
Which seemed fine, but the more I looked at it the more I didn't understand why he made the changes he did.
He has a [vanilla cake recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/1448-2/) that seems normal, pretty similar to [other vanilla cake recipes out there](https://livforcake.com/vanilla-cake/#wprm-recipe-container-8624).

But for this recipe,
* why use the ["reverse creaming" method](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/03/09/what-is-reverse-creaming-and-why-does-it-make-great-cake)? that seems to result in a crumblier cake?
* why decrease the baking powder?
* why use egg whites instead of whole eggs?
* why use sour cream and milk instead of buttermilk?

I found a similar recipe at https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/oreo-cake-recipe/, which has a slightly different recipe, but actually explains some things.
She uses a [white cake base](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/white-cake-recipe/), so it looks nicer with the oreos (not a yellow cake), so that's why there are no yolks.
And it uses the traditional creaming method.
It uses milk instead of buttermilk so the cake is strong enough to support the cookies.
She also takes out the filling before chopping so it doesn't melt and leave holes in the cake.

So, I'm going to use her recipe, but his construction.
Her 2" tall pans look pretty full, so I think I can do 4 x 6" pans with only 1" or so of batter in them, without scaling her recipe (her recipe makes more batter anyway).

Not sure what buttercream I will use though. TBD.
