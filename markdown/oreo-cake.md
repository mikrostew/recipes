## Notes

From https://preppykitchen.com/cookies-and-cream-cake/

His recipe seems fine, basically a vanilla cake with chopped Oreos, buttercream with crushed Oreos, and ganache.
It's using the ["reverse creaming" method](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/03/09/what-is-reverse-creaming-and-why-does-it-make-great-cake) (TIL), which seems to result in a denser cake, for stacking in tiers I guess.
(Some comments say it's dense)

If there's a reason that this cake needs it, he doesn't explain it.

So whatever, I'm going adjust the directions to use the creaming method.
I'm only doing 2 layers.

Since I'm using 4 pans instead of 3 I had to scale the recipe accordingly.
