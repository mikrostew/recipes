## Ingredients

Cake

* [ ] 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* [ ] 3/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 10 ounces (283 g) milk, room temperature
* [ ] 2 ounces (57 g) vegetable oil
* [ ] 2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract
* [ ] 8 ounces (227 g) unsalted butter, room temperature
* [ ] 14 ounces (397 g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 6 large (198 g) egg whites, room temperature
* [ ] 4 ounces (113 g) roughly chopped Oreo cookies (about 12 Oreos), without filling

Oreo Buttercream

* [ ] 16 ounces (454g) unsalted butter room temperature
* [ ] 32 ounces (907g) powdered sugar
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] 4 Tbsp (60g) heavy cream
* [ ] leftover Oreo filling, heated
* [ ] 6.5 ounces (185g) crushed Oreo cookies (about 16 Oreos), without filling

Ganache

* [ ] 1 cup (200g) semisweet chocolate chips
* [ ] 1 cup (200g) heavy cream

## Directions

Cake

* Make sure the cold ingredients (butter, eggs, and milk) are at room temperature (usually takes at least an hour).
* Scrape the cream filling from the Oreos and save to mix into the frosting. Roughly chop the oreos into 1/4-inch chunks.
* Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease and flour four 6" round cake pans.
* In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
* In a measuring cup, combine milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Set aside.
* Place the softened butter in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and cream until smooth (1-2 minutes). Add sugar and whip on medium-high until light, white, and fluffy (about 5 minutes).
* While mixing on low, slowly add the egg whites to the mixture one at a time, letting each fully combine before adding the next. (Cold egg whites will curdle the batter, so make sure they're room-temperature.)
* Add in 1/3 of your dry ingredients to the mixture and mix on low until just combined. Then add in 1/2 of your liquids, then 1/3 dry, then 1/2 liquids, and the rest of your dry. Let it mix until just combined. Do not overmix!
* Divide the batter evenly into prepared cake pans and sprinkle the chopped oreos on top of each pan. Gently fold the oreos into the batter with a knife until just combined.
* Bake cakes at 325°F for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with some wet crumbs (not raw batter) when poked in the center.
* Let the cakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes or until the pan feels barely warm then turn out cakes onto a cooling rack. Place them into the freezer to flash chill, or wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 week (this locks in the moisture).
* Once cool, you can trim off the brown edges and domes of your cakes (optional) and frost as desired. I recommend doing a crumb coat, freezing the cake for 15 minutes, then doing a final coat.

Oreo Buttercream

* Prepare a stand mixer with a whisk attachment.
* Whisk butter until creamy.
* Reduce speed to low and add powdered sugar 1 cup at a time until well blended, then increase speed to medium and beat for 3 minutes.
* Add vanilla, salt and 2 Tbsp cream and continue to whip on medium for 1 minute.
* Heat leftover Oreo filling in microwave until melty, then add in while mixing.
* Add more cream as needed until desired consistency is reached.
* Whip until the frosting is smooth and silky.
* Reserve any buttercream needed for white decorations.
* Mix in the crushed Oreos into the large batch of buttercream.

Ganache

* Place the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl.
* Heat the cream in a double boiler until it's not quite at a simmer, but showing fine bubbles around the edge (goal is 200°F).
* Pour the cream over the chocolate, stir very briefly to combine, and let rest for 5 minutes. Stir again — at first slowly, then more vigorously — until the chocolate is completely melted and the glaze is smooth.
* If any bits of chocolate remain, reheat briefly, then stir until smooth.

Assembly

* Oreo frosting goes between each layer as well as a swirl of chocolate (don't go overboard, the ganache will overpower the other flavors).
* Coat outside with buttercream and smooth.
* Add a skirt of crushed Oreos at the bottom of the cake.
* Pour the ganache on top and allow to drip. Smooth top with an offset spatula.

## Notes

Started with https://preppykitchen.com/cookies-and-cream-cake/, because that was the top result that didn't use chocolate layers when I [searched for oreo cake](https://www.google.com/search?q=oreo+cake).
(I don't want to do chocolate layers)
And I like the idea of also using ganache.

The recipe seemed to be a vanilla cake with chopped Oreos in it, buttercream with crushed Oreos, and ganache.
Which seemed fine, but the more I looked at it the more I didn't understand why he made the changes he did.
He has a [vanilla cake recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/1448-2/) that seems normal, pretty similar to [other vanilla cake recipes out there](https://livforcake.com/vanilla-cake/#wprm-recipe-container-8624).

But for this recipe,
* why use the ["reverse creaming" method](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/03/09/what-is-reverse-creaming-and-why-does-it-make-great-cake)? that seems to result in a crumblier cake?
* why decrease the baking powder?
* why use egg whites instead of whole eggs?
* why use sour cream and milk instead of buttermilk?

I found a similar recipe at https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/oreo-cake-recipe/, which has a slightly different recipe, but actually explains some things.
She uses a [white cake base](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/white-cake-recipe/), so it looks nicer with the oreos (not a yellow cake), so that's probably why there are no yolks.
And it uses the traditional creaming method.
It uses milk instead of buttermilk so the cake is strong enough to support the cookies.
She also takes out the filling before chopping so it doesn't melt and leave holes in the cake.

So, I'm going to use her recipe, but his construction.
Her 2" tall pans [look pretty full](https://sugargeekshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/oreo_cake_recipe-15-of-32.jpg), so I think I can do 4 x 6" pans with only 1" or so of batter in them, without scaling her recipe (her recipe makes more batter anyway).

For buttercream, I like [this recipe](https://livforcake.com/simple-vanilla-buttercream/), so I'll basically do that but adding crushed oreos like the other 2 recipes. I like the look of the preppy kitchen frosting, so I'll add about that much of the crushed oreos, with the butter and sugar amounts from sugargeekshow recipe (it makes more).

For ganache, I already [have some recipes for that](./chocolate-ganache.md), so I'll use that, in a 1:1 ratio to get a thick glaze consistency.
