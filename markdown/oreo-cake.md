* [ ] 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 200g
* [ ] 1/2 cup Heavy cream 110g, heated

## Directions

Cake

* Butter and flour three six inch pans. I use cake strips on my pans for more even baking as well. Preheat oven to 340F
* In a standing mixture fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter until light and fluffy.
* Sift the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
* Beat the dry ingredients into the butter until well incorporated, scrape the bowl at least once.
* Beat the wet ingredients together in a medium bowl.
* Add the wet to the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Fold in the crushed Oreos at the very end and mix until just combined.
* Divide the mixture evenly into the cake pans
* Bake at 340 for about 25-30 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch.

Buttercream

* Beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar and cream and mix. 
* Reserve about a cup of the buttercream for the white dollops. Which will be piped with an 869 tip.
* Mix in the crushed Oreos into the large batch of buttercream.

Ganache

* Melt chocolate and cream together on low heat. Whisk together and set aside. You might need to add more or less cream to achieve the desired consistency. 

Assembly

* Oreo buttercream goes between each layer as well as a swirl of chocolate. Don't go overboard with the ganache as it will overpower the other flavors.
* Coat outside with buttercream and smooth.
* Add a skirt of crushed Oreos at the bottom of the cake.
* Pour the ganache on top and allow to drip. Smooth top with an offset spatula.
* Pipe white buttercream dollops on top with an 869 tip

## Notes

From https://preppykitchen.com/cookies-and-cream-cake/

His recipe seems fine, basically a vanilla cake with chopped Oreos, buttercream with crushed Oreos, and ganache.
It's using the ["reverse creaming" method](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/03/09/what-is-reverse-creaming-and-why-does-it-make-great-cake) (TIL), which seems to result in a denser cake, for stacking in tiers I guess.
(Some comments say it's dense)

If there's a reason that this cake needs it, he doesn't explain it.

So whatever, I'm going adjust the directions to use the creaming method.
I'm only doing 2 layers.

Since I'm using 4 pans instead of 3 I had to scale the recipe accordingly.
