## Notes

From https://preppykitchen.com/cookies-and-cream-cake/

His recipe seems fine, basically a vanilla cake with chopped Oreos, buttercream with crushed Oreos, and ganache.
What seems off about the recipe is how the ingredients are combined: he doesn't cream the butter and sugar together, mixes in the dry stuff first, then does the wet stuff.
Some comments say it's dense, which doesn't surprise me.

It's weird, he has a vanilla cake recipe where he combines things in more or less the "usual" way: https://preppykitchen.com/1448-2/.
If there's a reason he does it differently, he doesn't explain it.

Whatever, I'm going to do it the usual way (cream butter and sugar, add eggs and vanilla, alternate wet and dry, etc).

Since I'm using 4 pans instead of 3 I had to scale the recipe accordingly.
