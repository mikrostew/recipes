# beef bulgogi bowls

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 cup Jasmine Rice
* [ ] Rice Wine Vinegar (or white wine vinegar)
* [ ] 1/2 tsp sugar
* [ ] 1 Cucumber, shaved into ribbons (or just sliced)
* [ ] 2 carrots, shredded
* [ ] 1 lb Ground Beef
* [ ] 1 thumb ginger, zested
* [ ] Sesame Seeds
* [ ] soy sauce
* [ ] 4 oz Bulgogi Sauce (or kung pao sauce)
* [ ] 1/4 cup Sour Cream
* [ ] Sriracha (to taste)
* [ ] 2 scallions, sliced (optional)

## Directions

* Place rice and 1 3/4 cup water in a small pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer until tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.

* Place some vinegar, the sugar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Add cucumber and toss to coat.

* Season carrots with salt and pepper and cook with a drizzle of oil over medium-high heat, until tender but still a little crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

* Brown beef, breaking up into pieces, about 5 minutes. Turn heat to high and cook beef without stirring until crispy on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Add ginger and sesame seeds and cook until fragrant, about a minute. Add vinegar and scrape up browned bits. Add some soy sauce and stir to combine. Add bulgogi sauce or kung pao sauce and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.

* While beef cooks, stir together sour cream and sriracha (to taste) in a small bowl. Stir in water until mixture has a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.

* Fluff rice with a fork and stir in 1 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice between bowls. Arrange beef, carrots, and cucumber on top, next to each other. Drizzle crema over everything. Garnish with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds.

Tried making bulgogi sauce, but it wasn't very good - might try again.
