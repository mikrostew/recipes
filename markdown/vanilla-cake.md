# vanilla cake

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature (1 stick; 113g)
* [ ] 1/2 cup vegetable oil (120ml)
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup granulated sugar (300g)
* [ ] 4 eggs, room temperature
* [ ] 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
* [ ] 3 cups all-purpose flour (375g) - or cake flour?
* [ ] 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 1/4 cup buttermilk, room temperature (300ml)
* [ ] 1 batch Chocolate Frosting (TODO)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and prepare two deep 8" round cake pans** by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and lightly greasing the sides. Set aside.

* In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl using an electric mixer) cream together the butter, canola oil and sugar until creamy and well-combined.

* Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

* Stir in vanilla extract.

* In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.

* Using a spatula and gently hand-mixing, alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with flour mixture and mixing until just combined after each addition.  The batter should be smooth and completely combined, but avoid over-mixing.

* Evenly divide batter into your prepared cake pans (roughly 450g in each), and bake on 350F (175C) for 25-30 minutes.  When the cake is done, the surface should spring back to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out mostly clean with few moist crumbs (no wet batter). Took me 27 minutes.

* Allow cakes to cool in their cake pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.

* Frost cake using my chocolate frosting (or see notes for other favorite frosting options) and decorate with sprinkles (if desired).

## Notes

This one is from https://sugarspunrun.com/vanilla-cake-recipe/.

Can use 9" cake pans instead, but watch the cooking time as they may need less time in the oven.

There are other recipes out there, kinda similar, might try those if this doesn't work out
