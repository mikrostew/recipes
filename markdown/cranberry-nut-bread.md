## Notes

Adapted from the [recipe that used to be on the Ocean Spray cranberry package](https://www.oceanspray.com/en/Recipes/By-Course/Breads-and-Muffins/Classic-Cranberry-Nut-Bread)

Could probably use more oil, to make this more moist. Taste should be fine, since there is a lot of tartness in this.
