# chocolate frosting

## Ingredients

* [ ] 6 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces of roughly the same size (170g)
* [ ] 1 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (226g)
* [ ] 2 cups powdered sugar (320g)
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 2 Tablespoons heavy cream (30ml)

## Directions

* Place your chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds.  Stir well.  Return chocolate to microwave and heat for another 15 seconds and stir again.  Continue heating chocolate for 15 seconds, stirring after each, until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.  

* Allow chocolate to cool for at least 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  You want chocolate to cool so that it is not hot to the touch, otherwise it will melt your butter and sugar and the frosting will not turn out.  

* While the chocolate is cooling, place butter in a separate bowl and use a stand mixer or electric mixer to beat until creamy.  

* Add melted, cooled chocolate and stir well.  

* Gradually add sugar, scraping down the sides and bottom of bowl occasionally so that ingredients are well combined.

* Sprinkle in salt and vanilla extract, stir well.

* With mixer on low, gradually add heavy cream to frosting.  Gradually increase speed to high and beat for 30 seconds.

* Pipe or spread frosting onto prepared, cooled baked good.
