# pumpkin pie

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 [pre-baked pie crust](./pie-crust.md)
* [ ] 2 large eggs, beaten
* [ ] 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree
* [ ] 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar

* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 can (12 fl oz) evaporated milk


## Directions

* In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and pumpkin puree. Combine the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt in a small bowl, then whisk that in. Slowly add the evaporated milk and whisk to combine. Pour the mixture into the pre baked pie crust.

* Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center of the pie just slightly jiggles. Cool on a wire rack.

* Serve slightly warm or at room temperature with whipped cream. Cover tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 more days.

## Notes

From https://www.hummingbirdhigh.com/2020/11/libbys-pumpkin-pie-recipe-elevated.html, which uses the [original Libby's recipe](https://www.verybestbaking.com/libbys/recipes/libby-s-famous-pumpkin-pie/) and tries to improves it with a pre-baked crust. I haven't had good results using a store-bought crust though.

Might try https://www.seriouseats.com/extra-smooth-pumpkin-pie-recipe, since the crust always comes out soggy with this recipe.
