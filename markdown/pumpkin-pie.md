# pumpkin pie

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 unbaked 9-inch (4-cup volume) deep-dish frozen pie crust
* [ ] 1 egg white
* [ ] 2 large eggs + 1 egg yolk
* [ ] 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree
* [ ] 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 can (12 fl oz) evaporated milk

## Pre-Bake the Crust

* Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper.

* Place the frozen crust, in the center of the pan. Cover the crust with foil, making sure the crimped edges are completely covered and that there are no gaps between the foil and the crust. Fill with pie weights.

* Bake for 30 minutes.

* In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and water.

* Carefully remove the pie weights and foil. Coat the bottom and sides of the pie crust with a thin layer of egg wash. Bake, uncovered, for an additional 5 minutes. Set aside on a wire rack to cool slightly.

## Make the Pie

* In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, and pumpkin puree. Whisk in the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt. Slowly add the evaporated milk and whisk to combine. Pour the mixture into the pre baked pie crust.

* Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center of the pie just slightly jiggles. Cool on a wire rack.

* Serve slightly warm or at room temperature with whipped cream. Cover tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 more days.
