# spiced beef wraps

## Ingredients

* 4 pocketless pitas (can be frozen)
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1-1/2 lbs (24 oz) ground beef
* 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 2 Tbsp [Za'atar Spice](./zaatar-spice.md)
* 1/2 cup beef stock
* 1 Tbsp better-than-bullion beef
* 1/2 cup Labneh Cheese (Creme Kefir)
* 2 cloves garlic, zested into a paste [optional]


## Directions

* Wrap pitas individually in aluminum foil, and warm in the oven at 400Â°F for 5-6 minutes (also works from frozen).

* Heat oil in a nonstick pan on medium-high. Saute the onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Season the beef with salt & pepper. Add the beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Turn heat to high and let the beef brown and crisp for a few minutes (5-ish?). Reduce the heat to medium, add the vinegar and scrape up the browned bits from the pan. Add the za'atar seasoning, stock, and bullion, stirring and letting that reduce for a few minutes. Season with salt & pepper to taste.

* In a bowl, stir the labneh, a drizzle of olive oil, and garlic (if you like) into a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

* Divide the labneh between the warmed pitas. Top with the cooked beef and a drizzle of olive oil. You can also add shredded lettuce here as well.
