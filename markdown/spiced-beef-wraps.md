# spiced beef wraps

## Ingredients

* 1-1/2 lbs (24 oz) ground beef
* 4 pocketless pitas (can be frozen)
* 1/2 cup Labneh Cheese (Creme Kefir)
* 2 Tbsp [Za'atar Spice](./zaatar-spice.md)
* 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 cup beef stock (beef, chicken, veg, whatever - even water is fine really)
* 2 cloves garlic, zested into a paste


## Directions

Wrap pitas individually in aluminum foil, and warm in the oven - 400Â°F-ish for 5-6 minutes (also works from frozen).

Season the beef with salt & pepper. Heat oil in a nonstick pan on medium-high. Add the beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Turn heat to high and let the beef brown and crisp for a few minutes (5-ish?). Reduce the heat to medium, add the vinegar and scrape up the browned bits from the pan. Add the za'atar seasoning and stock, stirring and letting that reduce for a few minutes.

In a bowl, combine the labneh, a drizzle of olive oil, and garlic if you like. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Divide the labneh between the warmed pitas. Top with the cooked beef and a drizzle of olive oil.
