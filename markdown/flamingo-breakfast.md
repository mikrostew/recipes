# flamingo breakfast

My daughter loves flamingos, and loves this breakfast

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 frozen waffle
* [ ] 1 banana
* [ ] red fruit (raspberries, strawberries, whatever)
* [ ] more fruit, nuts, coconut, dried fruit, etc.

## Directions

_(Refer to picture above to make sense of these directions)_

* Toast the waffle. Cut off two small sections for the legs, and arrange on the plate.

* Cut off a small angled section at the curvier end of the banana. Arrange both pieces on top of the waffle, using the large piece for the neck and head, and the small section for the tail.

* Arrange red fruit on top of the waffle. Cut a small round piece to use for the eye. Add whatever other fruit or nuts or coconut or whatever you like. Serve with maple syrup.
