# flamingo breakfast

My daughter loves flamingos, and loves this breakfast

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 frozen waffle
* [ ] 1 banana
* [ ] fruit, nuts, coconut, whatever

## Directions

* Toast the waffle. Trim off two small sections for the legs (see picture), and arrange on the plate.

* Cut off a small angled section at the curvier end of the banana. Arrange both pieces on top of the waffle, using the small section for the tail.

* Arrange fruit (strawberries, raspberries, something red is good) on top of the waffle. Cut a small round piece to use for the eye. Add whatever other fruit or nuts or coconut you like. Serve with maple syrup.
