# biscuits

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 Cups (250g) **flour**†, plus some for rolling out
* [ ] 3 tsp **baking powder**
* [ ] 1/2 tsp **baking soda**
* [ ] 1/2 tsp **salt**
* [ ] 1/4 Cup (1/2 stick; 4 Tbsp; 60g) **butter**
* [ ] 1/4 Cup (4 Tbsp; 60g) **shortening**
* [ ] 1 Cup (8oz) **buttermilk**, chilled

† _Use soft southern wheat flour (White Lily), or 4 parts all purpose to 1 part cake flour (200g:50g)_

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 400°F.

* In a large mixing bowl, combine **flour**, **baking powder**, **baking soda** and **salt**. Using a pastry cutter (or spoon, or your fingers), work **butter** and **shortening** into dry ingredients until mixture resembles bread crumbs or cornmeal. Add **buttermilk**, and stir with a fork just until the dough comes together (it will be very sticky).

* Turn dough onto floured surface, and gently pat out into a 1-inch thick round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2 1/2-inch cutter (or the rim of a cup) - push down all the way and twist. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch ("shoulder to shoulder"). Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible, and continue cutting.

* Push biscuits down in the center with your thumb (to get an even rise). Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, about 15 minutes. Optionally brush tops with melted butter 


## Notes

I started out with using [Alton Brown's recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe-2041990), and used tips from the [white lily flour recipe](https://www.whitelily.com/recipes/white-lily-light-and-fluffy-biscuits-3790).

It turns out that the [video linked from Alton's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHD__HkfexY) has more detail, and is a bit different. I incorporated some suggestions from that as well.

That video clip comes from [Good Eats S1 E7, "The Dough Also Rises"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR6DWOa4ejs), but it is edited from the original. Notes on the full episode:
* "a pint is a pound the world around"
* using a mix of shortening and butter, for tenderness and flavor
* can use self-rising flour if you want
* can sift the flour, to possibly make a lighter biscuit
* you're looking for a very wet dough, if it looks sticky and nasty you're on the right track
* for a neater kitchen you can roll out on parchment paper
* tip: use a heavy duty half-sheet aluminum baking pan, which won't burn biscuit bottoms like non-stick or dark pans
* biscuits get volume from steam and the CO2 from the chemical leaveners - acid + alkaline = gas, and double-acting baking powder has both, so it reacts once when wet, then again when hot
* a lot of ingredients throw off the balance, so we add baking soda to counteract the added acidity


I've seen some other recipes that advise freezing the butter for a bit then grating it, like [this one](https://sugarspunrun.com/easy-homemade-biscuits/), but it doesn't come out any different when I've tried that. And it just gets more things dirty.
