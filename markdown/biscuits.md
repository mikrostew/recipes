# biscuits

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 Cups (250g) **flour**, plus some for rolling out
* [ ] 4 tsp (15g) **baking powder**
* [ ] 1/4 tsp (2g) **baking soda**
* [ ] 3/4 tsp (5g) **salt**
* [ ] 1/4 Cup (1/2 stick) **butter**
* [ ] 1 Cup (8oz) **buttermilk**, chilled

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 450°F _[seems too hot?]_.

* In a large mixing bowl, combine **flour**, **baking powder**, **baking soda** and **salt**. Using a pastry cutter (or your fingertips), work **butter** into dry ingredients until crumbs are the size of peas (faster the better). Add **buttermilk**, and stir with a fork just until the dough comes together (it will be very sticky).

* Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. Press into a 1-inch thick round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2-inch cutter or the rim of a cup. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough (working it as little as possible) and continue cutting.

* Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes.


## Notes

Based on [Alton Brown's recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe-2041990) and the [white lily flour recipe](https://www.whitelily.com/recipes/white-lily-light-and-fluffy-biscuits-3790).

The [video linked from the FN article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHD__HkfexY) has more detail, and is a bit different:
* use soft winter wheat flour (probably white lily)
* flour weight is about 10oz (280g)
* "a pint is a pound the world around"
* he measures the buttermilk (8oz), then adds 1oz of butter, and 2oz shortening
* work the dough gently (no folding), and pat out gently
* biscuit cutter - push down all the way and twist
* biscuits should just touch on the pan - "shoulder to shoulder"
* push biscuits down in the center with your thumb, to get an even rise
* bake in a 400°F oven, until golden

That clip comes from Good Eats S1 E7, "[The Dough Also Rises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR6DWOa4ejs)"
* use soft southern wheat, or 3 parts all purpose : 1 part cake flour
* mix of shortening and butter, for tenderness and flavor


I've seen some other recipes that advise freezing the butter for a bit then grating it, like [this one](https://sugarspunrun.com/easy-homemade-biscuits/), but it doesn't come out any different when I've tried that. And it just gets more things dirty.
