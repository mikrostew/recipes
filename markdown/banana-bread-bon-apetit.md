Makes a dense loaf of bread

## Ingredients

* 1-1/2 cups (195g) all-purpose flour
* 1-1/4 teaspoons baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup (225g) dark brown sugar, packed
* 1/3 cup sour cream, Greek yogurt, or mascarpone
* 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 large eggs (room temp?)
* 1-1/2 cups (375g) ripe bananas, mashed (about 3 large)
* 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate [optional]
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts [optional]

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat a 8-1/2" x 4-1/2" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. Leave an overhang on long sides to easily grab and remove after baking.

* Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.

* Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar, mascarpone, and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed.

* Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Add bananas and mix just until combined. Fold in chocolate and/or walnuts, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.

* Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–65 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 1 hour. Turn out bread and let cool completely (if you can resist) before slicing.

## Notes

Made this with chopped chocolate but I would just use chocolate chips next time.
