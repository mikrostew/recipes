# charoset (apple and walnut)

made this for passover:
[Traditional Apple-Walnut Charoset](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/traditional-apple-walnut-charoset-234298)

Ingredients

* 3 medium Gala or Fuji apples, peeled, cored, and finely diced
* 1 1/2 cups walnut halves, lightly toasted, cooled, and coarsely chopped
* 1/2 cup sweet red wine such as Manischewitz Extra Heavy Malaga
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar

Preparation

* In large bowl, stir together all ingredients. Store, covered, at room temperature until ready to serve.

Notes

* For the most even texture, we recommend dicing the apples by hand. However, to save time, they can be chopped in the food processor â€” just be careful not to overprocess.


Helpful Comments - TODO: incorporate these

Took this to a friend's seder and was asked for the recipe. Everyone loved it! I followed the basic recipe, with a few tweaks, using Gala, Fugi and Granny Smith apples - hand chopped and sprinkled with juice of half a lemon. I borrowed the idea from another reviewer and added the zest of one orange. I toasted the walnuts at 275 degrees for 25 minutes before hand chopping them. Instead of sugar, I sweetened it to taste with clover honey.

I used galas and granny smiths (good for a little tartness) a combo of almonds and walnuts and no brown sugar. I added a little raw honey and the secret ingredient that brings this to a higher level: orange zest. It brightens the dish and makes it a bit more special. I'd love to eat it with yogurt as another cook suggested, but will have to make more next week since I don't have any leftovers (it was that good!)
