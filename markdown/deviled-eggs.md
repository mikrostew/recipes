# deviled eggs

Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

* [ ] 12 eggs
* [ ] 1/4 cup mayo
* [ ] 2 tsp relish
* [ ] 2 tsp yellow mustard
* [ ] lemon juice (to taste)
* [ ] salt and pepper (to taste)
* [ ] paprika (for garnish)

## Directions

- **Boil eggs:** Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for 8 minutes. Prepare an ice bath while eggs are cooking. When finished boiling, drain water and place eggs in the ice bath for a couple minutes.

- **Make filling:** Crack egg shells, peel, and rinse under cold water. Dry with paper towels. Slice eggs in half length-wise, placing yolks in a medium bowl, and whites on a separate plate. Mash the yolks into a crumble. Add mayo, relish, and mustard, mashing until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

- **Combine:** Place the yolk mixture into a piping bag (or ziplock with a corner cut off). Pipe into egg whites, sprinkle with paprika using a strainer, and serve.

## Notes

Quantities are not exact, I just do this one by taste.

You can also add other stuff (look online), but I mostly just make this basic recipe.
