# pancakes

## Ingredients

* 1 egg
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 2 Tbsp oil
* 1 cup all-purpose flour (can use 1/2 whole wheat) †
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions

Beat egg; add buttermilk and oil. Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Mix dry ingredients into wet, stirring until just combined (batter will be lumpy).

Grease heated griddle with butter. Pour batter onto hot griddle. Turn pancakes as soon as they are puffed and full of bubbles (before the bubbles break). Bake other side until golden brown.

Makes 10 4-inch pancakes.
