# pancakes

Betty Crocker

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 eggs
* [ ] 2 cups buttermilk (or kefir)
* [ ] 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp) oil
* [ ] 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (can use 1/2 whole wheat) †
* [ ] 1 Tbsp sugar
* [ ] 2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt

† _If using self-rising flour, omit baking powder and salt and decrease soda to 1/2 tsp_

## Directions

Beat egg; add buttermilk and oil. Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Mix dry ingredients into wet, stirring until just combined (batter will be lumpy).

Grease heated griddle with butter. Pour batter onto hot griddle (1/4 cup is about right). Turn pancakes as soon as they are puffed and full of bubbles (before the bubbles break). Bake other side until golden brown.

Makes 20 4-inch pancakes.


## Notes

From Betty Crocker, via my Mom :)

Incorporated some ideas from [The Food Lab's old recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20150214024836/https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/06/light-and-fluffy-pancakes-recipe.html)
* double all quantities, since I usually do that anyway
* less sugar
* melted butter instead of oil

Their [new recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-pancakes-recipe) is too involved
