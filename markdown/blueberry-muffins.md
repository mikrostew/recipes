# blueberry muffins

Makes 12 muffins

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1-1/2 cups (180g) all-purpose flour (can use some whole wheat)
* [ ] 3/4 cup (150g) white sugar (can use some brown)
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1 egg
* [ ] 1/3 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)
* [ ] zest from 1 lemon
* [ ] 1/2-ish cup buttermilk (or kefir, or 1/4 cup milk + 1/4 cup sour cream)
* [ ] 1+ cup (150-200g) fresh blueberries (or thawed from frozen†)

† _but that's not as good_

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350°F. Line with muffin liners (or grease the cups, but that doesn't work as well).

* Whisk flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda together in a medium bowl. Beat egg in a measuring cup; add the oil, lemon zest, and enough buttermilk to reach the 1-cup mark. (Or use milk + sour cream if you don't have buttermilk.) Mix into the flour mixture, but don't overbeat. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups two-thirds full (1/4 cup batter per muffin is about right).

* Bake for 20 minutes, or until done, rotating halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

TODO: do this with less sugar next time

Do buttermilk substitues work?

Kefir is a good sub for buttermilk. I use that often.

I've read about tossing the blueberries in flour then folding them in, but that [probably doesn't help](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/how-to-stop-blueberries-from-sinking-muffin-baking.html).
