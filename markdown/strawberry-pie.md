# strawberry pie

I like this because it doesn't use Jello

## Ingredients

Crust (didn't make this):

* [ ] 8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted, using more if needed
* [ ] 14 ounces graham crackers (about 24 crackers), crushed into fine crumbs in a food processor or blender

Strawberry Filling:

* [ ] 2 pounds (32 oz) fresh strawberries, hulled, divided [12 oz + 20 oz]
* [ ] ~1/2 cup (4 oz) granulated sugar
* [ ] 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) powdered unflavored gelatin [same]
* [ ] Pinch kosher salt
* [ ] 1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)

## Directions

**Crust**

* In a medium bowl, stir butter into graham cracker crumbs until evenly incorporated. Firmly press into an even layer lining the bottom and sides of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate; it helps to use the bottom of a measuring cup to flatten bottom of crust evenly. Refrigerate until ready to fill.

**Strawberry Filling**

* Place 12 ounces of **strawberries** in a blender (or food processor) and blend to a smooth puree. (This makes about 1.5 cups, but my blender doesn't blend well with fewer strawberries than that. If using a food processor you may only need 6 ounces? I haven't tried that.) Reserve 3/4 cup puree in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup (and enjoy the rest).

* Cut remaining **strawberries** into slices, transfer to a large bowl, and stir in the **sugar**. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until berries release about 3/4 cup liquid (about 1 hour). Measure out enough macerating liquid to combine with strawberry puree for 1 1/2 cups total. Drain macerated berries of any extra liquid (combine with extra puree and enjoy).

* Place 2 Tablespoons **water** in a small microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle **gelatin** evenly on top and let stand 5 minutes. Microwave gelatin mixture until melted and hot, about 10 seconds.

* Scrape melted gelatin into a large bowl, then gradually whisk in strawberry puree mixture until well combined. Whisk in **salt**.

* Add drained macerated strawberry chunks and stir to combine. Adjust taste with lemon juice, if desired, then immediately pour into the prepared pie crust. Turn the berries on top skin side up for best presentation. Refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours. Serve with whipped cream. 

## Notes

From https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/summer-strawberry-pie-recipe.html. The original recipe looks like it was (mostly) doubled, as one commenter pointed out. This recipe is what I actually used when I made this.

Also, I used a store-bought crust, which I pre-baked, and it was fine. Next time I would try the graham cracker crust here.
