# banana bread

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups (187g) flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp (1 1/2 tsp) ground cinnamon
* [ ] 1 1/2 eggs
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) vegetable oil
* [ ] 3 Tbsp butter, melted
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) white sugar
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar, packed
* [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] 2-ish cups? (360g) mashed bananas†
* [ ] 1/2 cup chopped nuts [optional]

† _3-4 ripe bananas_


## Directions

* Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour an 8 x 4 inch pan. 

* Combine flour, salt, baking powder, soda, and cinnamon in a bowl.

* Beat eggs, oil, butter, vanilla, and sugar together in another bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture (just dump it all in), and mix until combined (it will be thick). Stir in banana (and nuts, if using). Pour batter into prepared pan.

* Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done (toothpick in the center comes out clean). Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes. Remove bread from pan, and completely cool.


## Notes

This is the [zucchini bread recipe](./zucchini-bread.md), but with bananas and some extra melted butter. This uses more bananas by weight, to keep the amount of water the same &mdash; zucchini is 90% water, vs. 75% for bananas.
