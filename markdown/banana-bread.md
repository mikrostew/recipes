# banana bread

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups (187g) flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* [ ] 1 1/2 eggs
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) vegetable oil
* [ ] 3 Tbsp butter, melted
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) white sugar
* [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar, packed
* [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] 2-ish cups? (350g) bananas, mashed †
* [ ] 1/2 cup chopped nuts [optional]

† _3-4 ripe bananas_


## Directions

* Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour an 8 x 4 inch pan. 

* Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, soda, and cinnamon in a bowl.

* Beat eggs, oil, butter, vanilla, and sugar together in another bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture (just dump it all in), and mix until combined (it will be thick). Stir in banana (and nuts, if using). Pour batter into prepared pan.

* Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done (toothpick in the center comes out clean). Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes. Remove bread from pan, and completely cool.


## Notes

This started as the [zucchini bread recipe](./zucchini-bread.md), but substituting bananas (along with other adjustments). This uses more bananas by weight, to keep the amount of water the same &mdash; zucchini is 90% water, vs. 75% for bananas.
