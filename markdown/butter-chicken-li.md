## Yogurt Marinade for Chicken

* [ ] 2 lbs. chicken thighs, preferably boneless and skinless
* [ ] 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
* [ ] 2 tablespoons garam masala spice blend
* [ ] 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
* [ ] 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* [ ] 4 each cloves garlic, grated

* Cut chicken thighs into 3/4 inch cubes. Combine yogurt, garam masala, ginger, salt, and garlic. Add cubed chicken thighs and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight for better flavor.

* Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove chicken from marinade, place in roasting pan and roast chicken for 10 to 12 minutes or until internal chicken temperature reaches approximately 150°F.


## Butter Sauce

* [ ] 2 tablespoons canola oil
* [ ] 1 cinnamon stick
* [ ] 2 Indian red chiles (arbol)
* [ ] 2 bay leaves
* [ ] 2 tablespoons grated ginger
* [ ] 2 tablespoons garlic (TODO: powder? grated?)
* [ ] 2 tablespoons garam masala
* [ ] TODO: maybe chicken stock or bullion?
* [ ] 28 ounces canned tomatoes, chopped
* [ ] 4 tablespoons butter
* [ ] 1/2 cup heavy cream
* [ ] 1 tablespoons chopped cilantro for garnish


* Gather all butter-sauce ingredients. Using large pot, over medium heat, heat canola oil. When hot, add cinnamon stick, bay leaves, red chiles, grated ginger and garlic. Cook for 30 seconds. Stir in garam masala and cook for 30 seconds. Add chopped tomatoes, and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn off heat, remove cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and chiles.

* Use an immersion blender or a regular blender, blending in small batches, to purée the sauce until smooth. Once blended, return pot to low heat, and continually stir in cream and butter until sauce is incorporated.

* Add the roasted chicken to the butter sauce pot. Stir often and cook until chicken temperature reaches 165°F.

* Serve with basmati rice and naan; garnish with chopped cilantro.

I made this before, and the depth of flavor wasn't there - maybe I'll add some stock or bullion next time...
