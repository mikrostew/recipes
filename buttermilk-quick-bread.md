# buttermilk quick bread + variations

## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
* 1/2 cup white sugar (4 ounces)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup buttermilk (8 ounces)
* 1 large egg
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, olive oil, or vegetable oil (2 ounces)


## Directions

* Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease or spray with nonstick cooking spray a standard 9x5 loaf pan.

* Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Melt the butter, if using. Whisk it in a separate bowl with the buttermilk and the egg.

* Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients. Gently stir and fold the ingredients until all the flour has been incorporated and a shaggy, wet batter is formed. Be careful not to over-mix.

* Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and pat it into the corners. Bake for 45-50 minutes. When finished, the loaf should be domed and golden, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing and slicing.

* Wrap baked loaves tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. Baked loaves can also be wrapped in plastic and aluminum foil and frozen for up to three months.

I made the Cranberry-Walnut variation, but it was a little dry - I would add more buttermilk next time I guess?
