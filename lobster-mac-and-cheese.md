# Lobster Mac & Cheese

* Slightly adapted from the [original recipe at Food Wishes](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/02/lobster-mac-and-cheese-is-it-really-hard.html)
* There is also a [video with step-by-step directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPO-wOlpN9I)

### Notes

The recipe page linked above doesn't have the steps detailed, so I took notes on the video and posted the steps here.
Much easier than watching through the video every time I want to make this.

Chef John uses 2 lobster tails, but we like more meat than that, so I use 3 here.
4 is too many, because they are too crowded in the pan and don't get a good sear.

Serves: 2

Total time: 1 hr 20 mins

### Ingredients

(for 2 large portions)

* [ ] vegetable oil
* [ ] 3 lobster tails (5-6 oz each)
* [ ] 2 Tbsp butter
* [ ] 1 1/2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1 1/2 Cups cold milk (12 fl oz - the small bottle at the grocery store)
* [ ] cayenne to taste (optional)
* [ ] 1/4 tsp paprika
* [ ] pinch ground nutmeg
* [ ] 3 drops Worcestershire sauce
* [ ] 4 ounces grated sharp white cheddar cheese
* [ ] 1 ounce grated Gruyere cheese
* [ ] 1 generous Cup elbow macaroni
* [ ] 1/2 tsp fresh thyme leaves (don't overdo this)

For the crumb topping (doubled from the original - I like a lot of breadcrumbs on this):
* [ ] 2 Tbsp melted butter
* [ ] 6 Tbsp panko breadcrumbs
* [ ] 4 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano

### Equipment

* [ ] Cheese grater
* [ ] Large pot
* [ ] Stainless steel pan
* [ ] Bowls, spatulas, tongs, whisk, strainer
* [ ] 2 Gratin dishes
* [ ] Baking sheet

### Prep (20 mins)

* [ ] Cut **lobster tails** in half, rinse and remove the vein.
* [ ] Cut the **cheddar** and **gruyere** off the blocks, weigh those, then shred. (I find it's easiest to grate onto wax paper, then combine in a bowl.)
* [ ] Measure out the **flour** and the **macaroni**.
* [ ] Measure out the **paprika** and **nutmeg** (together).
* [ ] Measure out the **breadcrumbs** and **grated parmesan** (together).
* [ ] Put the 2 tbsp **butter** in a bowl for melting later.
* [ ] Strip leaves from **thyme sprigs**.

### Cook (1 hr)

* [ ] Preheat oven to *400°F*, and start a large pot of salted water boiling.
* [ ] Heat a stainless pan on *medium-high* until hot. Add **vegetable oil** and sear **lobster tails** for 2 minutes on each side, then set on a plate to rest.
* [ ] Turn the heat *off*, and melt 2 Tbsp **butter** in the pan. Turn heat to *medium* and whisk in the **flour** (making a rue). Cook for a minute or 2. Stir in the **cold milk**, cooking until it starts to simmer. Reduce heat to *low*. Stir in **paprika**, **nutmeg**, and **Worcestershire**. Taste for salt. Let that cook for 3-4 minutes.
* [ ] While the sauce heats up and cooks: Pull the meat out of the **lobster tails**, and add the shells to the pot of boiling water. Cook the **macaroni** for 9 minutes, to about al dente. Roughly chop the **lobster meat**.
* [ ] After the **sauce** is done cooking: Turn the heat *off* and stir the **shredded cheeses** into the sauce until just melted.
* [ ] When the **macaroni** is done cooking: Remove the **shells** from the pot, and save two of the nicest ones. Reserve some pasta water, then drain the **macaroni** (use a strainer) and add to the cheese sauce. Add a few splashes of pasta water to the sauce, so it's not so thick. Add the **fresh thyme leaves**. Taste for salt. Add the **lobster meat**.
* [ ] Make the crumb topping: Melt the **butter** in the bowl (microwave 20-30 seconds). Stir in the **breadcrumbs** and **parmesan** - should be just moistened. Season with salt and pepper.
* [ ] Divide the **mac and cheese** between the gratin dishes. Top with the **breadcrumb** mix.
* [ ] Bake at *400°F* on a baking sheet for 15-20 minutes, or until browned. Don't overbake (will get greasy), but use broiler for about 30 seconds at the end if needed to brown the top.

Let cool for about 5 minutes before serving
