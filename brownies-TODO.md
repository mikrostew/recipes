both of these list ingredient weights, which is usually a good sign:

make this one first: https://www.inspiredtaste.net/24412/cocoa-brownies-recipe/
* interesting double boiler technique, reminds me of ganache

and this looks good: https://preppykitchen.com/brownie-recipe/
* I like the ingredient formatting
* one thing he mentions is to build an 8x8 size out of alu foil, which is great since I don't have 8x8



TODO: I should check out this pro chef brownie video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nux4jTlJGks


this is supposedly like a boxed mix: https://www.loveandlemons.com/brownies-recipe/

this looks like a good basic recipe: https://cafedelites.com/best-fudgy-cocoa-brownies/ (and is very similar to https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10549/best-brownies/, minus the baking powder - because why would you put baking powder in brownies anyway?)
