# ground beef stroganoff

Made in one skillet

## Ingredients

* [ ] 8 oz. white button mushrooms, sliced and chopped
* [ ] 2 tbsp butter
* [ ] 1/2 onion, diced
* [ ] 1 clove garlic, chopped
* [ ] 1 lb. ground beef
* [ ] 3 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1 tsp paprika
* [ ] 1/4 cup wine (sherry, or whatever)
* [ ] 4 cups beef stock
* [ ] 1 Tbsp better than bullion beef
* [ ] 8 oz (4 cups) dry egg noodles
* [ ] 1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream
* [ ] 1/4 cup parsley, chopped

## Directions

* Add a drizzle of olive oil and mushrooms to a large skillet, season with salt, and sauté over medium-high heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Set aside.

* Melt the butter, add onion and garlic, season with salt, and sauté until tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, season with salt, and cook, breaking it up until cooked through. Drain any extra fat and return skillet to heat.

* Stir in the flour and paprika and cook for about a minute. Add the wine and stir, scraping any browned bits from the pan, cooking until mostly evaporated.

* Gradually stir in the beef stock and bullion, and season with salt. Bring mixture to a boil and add egg noodles. Reduce heat to a simmer and cover. Stir occasionally until noodles are tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Return the mushrooms to the skillet and stir to combine.

* Stir in the sour cream, to taste, and and freshly chopped parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm and enjoy!

## Notes

From https://iwashyoudry.com/one-skillet-ground-beef-stroganoff/. The supposed 15 minute cook time is ridiculous. This takes 30 minutes. I had to salt it well throughout.
