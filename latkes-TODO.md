# latkes

Made these for the holiday party: https://bakedbree.com/potato-latkes

with a couple changes: yukon gold potatoes, 3 eggs instead of 2, 3 Tbsp flour instead of 2

next time: I didn't have enough time to use it this time, so next time I would give myself more time, wring the potatoes into a bowl, let that settle, and incorporate the settled starch at the bottom back into the mix
