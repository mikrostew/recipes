# lemon ricotta pancakes 2

## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 1/4 cups (280g) flour
* [ ] 2 teaspoons baking powder
* [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups cold milk (or water)
* [ ] 1 teaspoon baking soda
* [ ] 1 cup (250g, 8.7oz) ricotta cheese
* [ ] 2 tablespoons grated lemon zest (or 1 Tbsp lemon extract)
* [ ] 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* [ ] 2 tablespoons white sugar
* [ ] 2 large eggs
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) melted butter
* [ ] 2 tablespoons lemon juice

## Directions

* Combine flour, baking powder, and salt, and set aside. (This is almost self-rising flour but not quite, it's missing baking soda)

* Whisk milk and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up any lumps of cheese. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and flour mixture. Whisk until most of flour disappears into the batter.

* Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.

* Heat lightly buttered (don't use oil, these will stick) cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
