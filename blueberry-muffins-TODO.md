# blueberry muffins - TODO

started with this recipe:

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218614/whole-wheat-blueberry-muffins/

changes:

instead of 1-1/2 cups whole wheat, I used 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup all purpose

and I followed the ideas from the most helpful comment:

"I made three small changes: I used a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda, melted butter instead of vegetable oil and I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. My applesauce was homemade. I always bake my muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. Nothing wrong with this recipe's bake time, it's just something I've always done (I bake A LOT of muffins, too!) These muffins turned out so good! Just the right amount of sweetness, perfectly moist, very flavorful. My sons and I really liked the combination of the blueberries and applesauce. Out of 12 muffins, there's two left. My sons ate most of them up this morning!"

for buttermilk I used 1/3 cup milk + 1 tsp vinegar, letting it sit and curdle while I put the dry ingredients together

plus tossing the blueberries in flour then folding them in (should have dried a bit them first, got some dough pieces in with the blueberries)
(probably doesn't help: https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/how-to-stop-blueberries-from-sinking-muffin-baking.html)

and I had to bake for about 24 minutes, because I put them in the paper liners
(and rotated halfway thru)

result:

they came out really good, tender and tasted good

next time:

I would add some lemon zest, whatever I get from a single lemon, and use the juice from that lemon to make the buttermilk (instead of vinegar)
