# chili

Makes a lot of good chili. Eat some, freeze the rest for later.

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 big can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
* [ ] 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
* [ ] 3 cans (15 oz) chili beans (Bush's is good)
* [ ] 1 can Kidney beans
* [ ] 1 can Pinto beans
* [ ] 2 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 1 tsp ground cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp ground mustard (or 1 Tbsp yellow mustard)
* [ ] 1/2 tsp cayenne [optional]
* [ ] 1 Tbsp Better Than Bullion
* [ ] 2 lbs ground chuck (80/20)
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic, grated [optional]
* [ ] 1 sweet onion, diced
* [ ] assortment of peppers (bell, anaheim, jalapeno, whatever), deseeded and sliced

## Directions

* Turn crockpot to high. Add both cans of tomatoes, reserving one empty can. Add 1 can of seasoned beans with all the liquid. Drain remaining beans and add. Add spices and bullion. Mix everything together.  Season with salt and pepper. Cover.

* In a skillet on medium-high, brown the beef with the garlic. Drain fat off into the tomato can. Add to crock pot.

* Turn broiler on high, and move a rack into position 8" away. Toss peppers and onion with salt, pepper, olive oil. Spread on baking sheet, and broil for 8-10 minutes, until softened & slightly charred. Add to crock pot.

* Once the chili is simmering, reduce the heat to low. Stir every now and then, for at least 2 hours. Leave the lid cracked, and let it cook down for another hour to reduce the liquid.
