# chili

A good fairly easy chili that I like to make

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 big can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
* [ ] 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
* [ ] 3 cans (15 oz) chili beans (Bush's is good)
* [ ] 1 can Chili beans (kidney)
* [ ] 2 cans Pinto beans (plain)
* [ ] 1/2 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* [ ] 1/4 tsp ground mustard
* [ ] 1/4 tsp cayenne
* [ ] 2 lbs ground chuck (80/20)
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic, grated
* [ ] 2 green peppers
* [ ] 1 sweet onion
* [ ] TODO: some beef bullion in here

## Directions

* Turn crockpot to high, and add both tomatoes. Add 1 can of seasoned beans with all the liquid. Drain remaining beans and add. Add spices. Mix everything together well and cover, season with salt and pepper.

* In a skillet on medium-high, brown the beef with the garlic. Drain fat off into the tomato can. Add to crock pot.

* Turn broiler on high.

* Chop green pepper and onion, season with salt, pepper, olive oil. Spread on baking sheet, and broil for ~10 minutes, until softened & slightly charred. Add to crock pot.

* Let this go for some hours (all day, or all night). Stir every now and then, when you happen to pass by. Leave the lid cracked, and let it cook down for about an hour.
