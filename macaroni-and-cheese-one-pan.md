# 3-Ingredient Stovetop Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients

* 6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni
* Salt
* 6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk
* 6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese (or any good melting cheese — Fontina, Gruyère, Jack)


## Directions

Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.


## Notes

I usually double this, since a can of evaporated milk is 12 oz.
