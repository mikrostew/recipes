# BAâ€™s Best Buttermilk Pancakes

From https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-buttermilk-pancakes

## Ingredients

* 1-1/3 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1-1/4 cups buttermilk
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* Vegetable oil (for griddle)
* Pure maple syrup (for serving)

## Directions

* Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and butter in a medium bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined (some lumps are okay).

* Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium; brush with oil. Working in batches, scoop 1/3-cupfuls of batter onto griddle. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through and other side of pancakes are golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes with maple syrup.
