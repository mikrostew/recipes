# lemon bars

## Notes

I made these: https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/luscious-lemon-squares.html, they were ok

* the filling was not bad, but a bit too sweet
  * it called for a lot of sugar, so I added an extra ~1/2 Tbsp of zest since I had big lemons, and rubbed the zest into the sugar to pull out the oils before incorporating
  * next time I would decrease the amount of sugar as well
* the crust was soggy - I baked it for over 20 min initially, but it wasn't getting that golden, and I didn't want to go too long and risk burning it after adding the filling
  * probably better to overbake than underbake this - would have been nice to have some guidance around that in the recipe itself or somewhere in all the text before it
  * also, maybe that's why she recommends lining with alu foil - I used parchment instead, because I didn't want to deal with the crust sticking to foil
* dunno whe she didn't include weights for the dry ingredients - measuring 1-3/4 cups and 2/3 cup flour gets 4 measuring cups dirty ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Dunno if I would make these again, maybe I would do one of these:
