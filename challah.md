### Notes

This uses about 1% yeast, which seems to be [standard for dry yeast](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/23085/yeast-percentages). Could also try this with fresh yeast, if I can find [where to buy it](https://food52.com/hotline/7533-where-should-i-buy-fresh-yeast).

Time: 4 hours (about 1 1/2 hours working plus 2 1/2 hours rising)

Yield: 1 loaf

### Ingredients

* [ ] 1 package (7g) active dry yeast
* [ ] 7/8 Cup lukewarm water (about 100°F - microwave cold water for 30 seconds)
* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp (7g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 1/4 Cup (60 ml) olive or vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the bowl
* [ ] 2 large eggs
* [ ] 1 large egg, separated
* [ ] 1/4 Cup (50g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp (7g) table salt
* [ ] 4 Cups (500g) all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1/2 cup raisins (optional)
* [ ] Poppy or sesame seeds (optional)

### Equipment

* [ ] Kitchen scale
* [ ] 2 Large mixing bowls
* [ ] Whisk
* [ ] Bench scraper
* [ ] 2 Baking sheets
* [ ] Parchment paper

### Make the Dough (30 minutes)

* [ ] Sprinkle the **yeast** over the **water** in a large bowl, and add 1/2 Tbsp **sugar**. Stir to dissolve, and let stand until you see a thin foamy layer on top, about 5 minutes. (Although dissolving yeast is [not really necessary these days?](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/09/25/active-dry-yeast/))
* [ ] Whisk in **oil**. Beat in 2 **eggs** and **yolk**, one at a time. Mix in remaining **sugar** and **salt**. Gradually add **flour**. When dough holds together, it is ready for kneading. (Can use a dough hook for this, but that's just going to get more things dirty.)
* [ ] Turn dough onto a floured work surface. Knead dough until smooth (about 10 minutes). If the dough is very sticky, add some **flour** until it feels tacky. The dough has finished kneading when it is soft, smooth, and holds a ball shape.

### First & Second Rise (1 hour 30 minutes)

* [ ] Place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. (Can set oven to *warm* for a couple minutes while the yeast proofs, then turn *off*.)
* [ ] Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another 30 minutes.

### Braid (15 minutes)

* [ ] Separate the dough into 6 equal pieces.
* [ ] Roll each piece of dough into a long rope roughly 1-inch thick and 16 inches long. If the ropes shrink as you try to roll them, let them rest for 5-10 minutes to relax the gluten and then try again.
* [ ] Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22p3wIHLupc) to make a 6-braid challah. (I could try to describe it here, but even with pictures this is confusing.)
* [ ] Place braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment.

### Last Rise (1 hour)

* [ ] Whisk remaining **egg white** with 1 Tbsp **water** and brush it on loaf. Either freeze or let rise another hour in the refrigerator.

### Bake (30-40 minutes)

* [ ] Preheat oven to *375°F* and brush loaves again. Sprinkle bread with **seeds**, if using. (If freezing, remove from freezer 5 hours before baking.)
* [ ] Place the baking sheet atop another baking sheet (to insulate the bottom crust, and keep it from browning too much). Bake in middle of oven for 30 to 40 minutes, rotating halfway through. Once it hits deep golden brown, can tent loosely with aluminum foil. Bread is done when it registers *190°F* in the center.

Cool loaf on a rack.
