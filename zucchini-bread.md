Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour (2 cups AP, 1 cup WW)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 2 1/4 cups white sugar (down to 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown)
* 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups grated zucchini (3 cups - about 500g)
* 1 cup chopped walnuts [optional]

Timing

Prep - 20m
Cook - 1h
Ready In - 1h 40m

(I didn't time this, but I bet the prep was more than 20m)


Directions


Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch pans. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Sift flour, salt, baking powder, soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.

Beat eggs, oil, vanilla, and sugar together in a large bowl. Add sifted ingredients to the creamed mixture, and beat well (at this point it will be pretty thick). Stir in zucchini [and nuts] until well combined. Pour batter into prepared pans.

Bake for 40 to 60 minutes, or until tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes. Remove bread from pan, and completely cool.


Notes

actually this was ~1-1/4 cups WW flour, since why leave 1/4 cup of flour, might as well finish it off
