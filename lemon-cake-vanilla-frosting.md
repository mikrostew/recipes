# lemon cake with vanilla bean frosting

## Ingredients

Cake:

* 3 cups (375g) cake flour
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp lemon zest (from about
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 5 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1-1/4 cups buttermilk, at room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Filling:

* 4 oz. mascarpone or cream cheese, cold
* 2-1/2 tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1-1/4 cups [150g] confectioners’ sugar, sifted
* 2 tsp. lemon extract
* Zest of ½ a lemon
* 1 cup heavy cream, chilled

Frosting:*

* 1-1/2 cups plus 2 tbsp. (3 sticks plus 2 tbsp.) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 3 cups [350g] confectioners’ sugar, sifted
* Pinch of salt
* 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 2 tbsp. heavy cream

Candied lemon slices (optional):

* 1-2 whole lemons, preferably organic
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water

_*Note: This will make a bit more frosting than you need for the cake.  You can scale it down a bit or just have left over frosting…always a good thing in my book._

## Equipment

* 3 8-inch round cake pans
* Medium mixing bowl
* Stand mixer with whisk and paddle attachments

## Directions

Cake:

* Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour the sides of 3 8-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper.

* In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder and salt. Combine the buttermilk and the vanilla extract in a liquid measuring cup.

* Add the sugar and lemon zest to the bowl of a stand mixer. Work the lemon into the sugar using your fingers. Add the butter, and cream using the whisk attachment, on medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, until light and creamy in color.

* Switch to the paddle attachment and mix in the eggs one at a time until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. On low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the wet ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and mixing just until incorporated.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds longer.

* Divide the batter between the prepared baking pans.  Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20-22 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking.  Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely [how long?].

## Notes

My stand mixer bowl weighs 650g (for dividing up the batter between cake pans), so if the batter weighs 2250g, thats ~520g per pan (accounting for some waste)
