# chicken rice casserole

Without using cans of soup

## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
* [ ] ~3/4 cups (170g) uncooked jasmine rice
* [ ] 3 cups (288g) frozen mixed veggies (carrots, corn, peas, and green beans, lima beans)
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* [ ] 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
* [ ] 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* [ ] 2 cups chicken stock
* [ ] 1/2 cup milk (whole, 2%, whatever)
* [ ] 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
* [ ] 4 chicken thighs, deboned, skin on, trimmed
* [ ] 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese (4 ounces)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 375°F. Coat an 11x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place rice then frozen vegetables in the dish. Set aside.

* Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion with salt until onion is soft but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

* Whisk in the flour, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

* Whisk in the chicken broth, breaking up any lumps of flour and onion and scraping browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.

* Add sauce to rice and vegetables in baking dish, and stir to combine.

* Season the chicken thighs with the remaining kosher salt and pepper. Set the chicken on top of the rice mixture. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.

* Bake until the rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 160°F, about 1 hour.

* Turn the oven off. Uncover and sprinkle with cheese. Return to the still-warm oven uncovered and let sit until the cheese melts, 2 to 4 minutes.

## Notes

Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
