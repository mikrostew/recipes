# slow cooker beef stroganoff

## Ingredients

1 Onion, large diced
2 cloves Garlic, sliced
2 lbs Beef Sirloin Steak (or chuck roast), cut into 1/2-inch-ish strips 
1 tsp Kosher Salt (or 1/2 tsp table salt)
1/2 tsp Pepper
2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
1 Tbsp Dijon
3 cups Beef Stock, low sodium

6 oz Cream Cheese, room temperature, cut in chunks
1 cup Sour Cream

12 oz Egg Noodles, cooked


## Instructions

* Spray the crock of your slow cooker with cooking spray, and turn on low.
 
* Cook the onions & garlic in olive oil over med-high heat for about 5 minutes. Add to the crock pot.

* Season the beef with salt & pepper, and sear it over high heat in batches. Add to the crock pot.

* Add the Worcestershire sauce, dijon, and beef stock. Stir well.

* Cook on Low for 8 hours.

* Add the cream cheese and stir to melt and combine. Place the lid back on.

* Cook the pasta to al dente. Drain, but don't rinse.

* In a bowl, add the sour cream. Then scoop out some of the hot liquid/sauce from the crock, and stir into the sour cream. Then add another scoop and stir. Then add the mixture into the crock with the beef (this process tempers the cold sour cream so it doesn't curdle when added to the hot liquid in the crock.).

* Add the noodles to the crock and gently stir.

* Serve hot.
