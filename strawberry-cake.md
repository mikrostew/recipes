With strawberry cream cheese frosting
 
## Strawberry Reduction (make ahead)

Make this a day or two ahead of time, and store it covered in the fridge

* [ ] 1 lb strawberries (fresh or thawed from frozen)

* Puree the strawberries in a blender, which should give about 2 cups. Simmer the puree over low heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Don't add sugar or anything to this.

## Cream Cheese Frosting (make ahead)

Make this the day before, then cover and refridgerate overnight

* [ ] 30-35g freeze-dried strawberries
* [ ] 1 8-ounce block full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* [ ] 1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* [ ] 3 cups (380g) confectioners’ sugar
* [ ] 1–2 Tablespoons milk
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] salt, to taste

* Using a food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a fine powder. Let it settle for a few minutes, to let the fine dust particles settle. You should have a little less than 1/2 cup. Set aside.

* In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.

* To color the frosting and give strawberry flavor, stir in powdered strawberries to taste/look.

## The Cake

* [ ] 2 - 1/2 cups (285g) sifted cake flour
* [ ] 2 teaspoons baking powder
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks, 170g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* [ ] 1 - 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 5 large egg whites (150g), at room temperature
* [ ] 1/3 cup (75g) sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature
* [ ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* [ ] 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature
* [ ] 1/2 cup reduced strawberry puree, at room temperature
* [ ] 1-2 drops red or pink food coloring (optional)

* Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch cake pans.

* Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.

* Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop.)

* Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24-25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.

* Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.

## Notes

From https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/strawberry-cake/

This came out slightly dry, but good flavor. I may have overbaked it, and maybe it needs a little more oil next time.
