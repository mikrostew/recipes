## Strawberry Reduction (make ahead)

Make this a day or two ahead of time, and store it covered in the fridge

* [ ] 1 lb strawberries (fresh or thawed from frozen)

* Puree the strawberries in a blender, which should give about 2 cups. Simmer the puree over low heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Don't add sugar or anything to this.

## Cream Cheese Frosting (make ahead)

Make this the day before, then cover and refridgerate overnight

* [ ] 1 cup (10-12g) freeze-dried strawberries
* [ ] 1 8-ounce block full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* [ ] 1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* [ ] 3 cups (380g) confectioners’ sugar
* [ ] 1–2 Tablespoons milk
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] salt, to taste

* Using a food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. Set aside.

* In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.
