## Ingredients

* 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour (can use some whole wheat)
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)
* 1/3+ cup buttermilk
* 1 cup fresh blueberries (or thawed from frozen)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.

* Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Beat egg in a measuring cup; add the oil, and enough buttermilk to reach the 1-cup mark. Mix into the flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups.

* Bake for 20 minutes, or until done, rotating halfway through.

## Notes

Next time: top off the buttermilk to 1 cup, try baking at 350, and add some lemon or orange zest

I've read about tossing the blueberries in flour then folding them in, but that probably doesn't help? https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/how-to-stop-blueberries-from-sinking-muffin-baking.html
