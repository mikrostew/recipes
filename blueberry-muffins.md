# blueberry muffins

Makes 12 muffins

## Ingredients

* 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour (can use some whole wheat)
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)
* zest from 1 lemon
* 1/2-ish cup buttermilk
* 1 cup fresh blueberries (or thawed from frozen)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease muffin cups, or line with muffin liners.

* Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Beat egg in a measuring cup; add the oil, lemon zest, and enough buttermilk to reach the 1-cup mark. Mix into the flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups two-thirds full.

* Bake for 20 minutes, or until done, rotating halfway through.

## Notes

Next time: measure out the batter with the 1/4 cup - using the 1/3 cup was too much batter per muffin.

I've read about tossing the blueberries in flour then folding them in, but that [probably doesn't help](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/how-to-stop-blueberries-from-sinking-muffin-baking.html).
