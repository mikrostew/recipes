# biscuits

Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 cup buttermilk, chilled

Directions

* Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
* In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry cutter (or your fingertips), work butter into dry ingredients until crumbs are the size of peas (faster the better). Add buttermilk, and stir with a fork just until the dough comes together (it will be very sticky).
* Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. Press into a 1-inch thick round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2-inch cutter or the rim of a cup. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough (working it as little as possible) and continue cutting.
* Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes.
